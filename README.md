# ABoVE_DA_LAIandBiomass
This repo includes scripts and files used to conduct model experiments described in the manuscript of the ABoVE data assimilation work. It also includes matlab scripts used to plot the figures and do the statistical analysis in the manuscript. The manuscript can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4NtlvAd91JJiQjqP6nnrKpwn3-B08l3t7bCRuDPPb0

1. FigureScripts:
 a) It includes matlab scripts to plot the figures and do the statistical analysis in the manuscript. Figure1-5.m correspond to figures in the main body of the manuscript, and FigureS1-S6.m correspond to figures in the supplement of the manuscript. Note Figure4 in the main body and FigureS3 in the supplement of the manuscript are generated by ILAMB (The International Land Model Benchmarking) not matlab scripts. The ILAMB repo used to do the ILAMB assessment (of which the result is shown in Figure4) in the manuscript is https://github.com/XueliHuo/ILAMB. It was forked from the https://github.com/rubisco-sfa/ILAMB and modified for our regional application. 
 b) Data used in the matlab scripts are stored on CyVerse and can be accessed from https://de.cyverse.org/data/ds/iplant/home/huoxl90/ABoVE_DA_Data/ABoVE_DA_LAIandBiomass_Data?type=folder&resourceId=5915919c-f830-11ed-a80f-90e2ba675364. In addition to the data used in the matlab scripts, this folder also includes two nc files: 
     1) LAIaSTD_stdfixed_025d_AddFillValue_2011-2020.nc is the observation of LAI regridded from the 500-m MODIS LAI. The obs_converter uses this nc file to generate the obs sequence files of LAI. Also, the obslaimonth.mat is created using the data in this nc file.
     2) Wang_BiomassandSTD_convert_to_carbon_2011t2014Sep.nc is the observation of aboveground biomass regridded from the 30-m machine learning product developed for the ABoVE core region. Same as LAI, it is used by the obs_converter to generate observation sequence files of aboveground biomass and the obstransbiomassinmodelarea.mat is the mat form of the data in this nc file.
